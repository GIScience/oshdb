# Code Style

We're using the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for the source code. With the [exception](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.3-camel-case) that the abbreviations `OSM`, `OSH` and `OSHDB` are allowed to be used in method and class names. For some popular IDEs and code linting tools you can find settings-files of the used code style in [./config/ide/](/config/ide/).
